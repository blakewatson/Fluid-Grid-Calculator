This is a tool that will help you create fluid grids in your CSS. Check out
the following article by Ethan Marcotte. In it, he explains the math behind
turning pixel values into percentages and ems.

"Fluid Grids"

The tool takes your target value (in pixels) and divides it by the pixel
value of the context. Here's an example:

You want to set the font size of your p tags to 14px. Currently, the font size
is the browser default of 16px. So you enter a target of 14 and a context
of 16. Click "Get Em" since you want the value in ems. That produces:

0.875em;  /* 14px / 16px */

You can paste that right into your CSS!

I made this because I am unable to use a regular keyboard. Instead, I use
an onscreen keyboard, which results in slow typing. This tool saves me
time by:

1) Doing the calculation
2) Writing out the CSS value
3) Adding the very handy comment containing the equivalent px values, and
4) Auto selecting the result for easy copying
